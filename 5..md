> [!theorem]

`\begin{proof}`
(using sequential version of continuity.)
1. Take $h=af+bg$ we want to show that $h$ is continous at $c$.
suppose $\left\{ x_{n} \right\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence in A converging to $C$ we wan tho show that $\left\{ h(x_{n}) \right\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$  converges to $h(c)$
$$
\begin{align}
h(x_{n} ) & =af(x_{n} )+bg(x_{n} ) \\
h(x_{n} ) & =af(c )+bg(c )  \text{ as } n\to \infty\\
h(x_{n} ) & =af(c )+bg(c ) \\
h(x_{n} ) & =h(c)

\end{align}
$$

2. Take $h=fg$ we want to show that $h$ is continous at $c$.
suppose $\left\{ x_{n} \right\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence in A converging to $C$ we wan tho show that $\left\{ h(x_{n}) \right\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$  converges to $h(c)$
$$
\begin{align}
h(x_{n} ) & =f(x_{n} )g(x_{n} ) \\
h(x_{n} ) & =f(c)g(c)  \text{ as } n\to \infty\\
h(x_{n} ) & =h(c)
\end{align}
$$

3. Take $h=\left( \frac{f}{g} \right)$ we want to show that $h$ is continuous at $c$.
suppose $\left\{ x_{n} \right\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is a sequence in A converging to $C$ we wan tho show that $\left\{ h(x_{n}) \right\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$  converges to $h(c)$ and $g(x)\neq0$ for all $x$ in $A$ then
$$
\begin{align}
h(x_{n} ) & =\frac{f(x_{n} )}{g(x_{n} )} \\
h(x_{n} ) & =\frac{f(c )}{g(c )} \text{ as } n\to \infty\\ 
h(x_{n} ) & =h(c)
\end{align}
$$
`\end{proof}`

> [!example] 
> Suppose $a_{0},a_{2}\dots a_{n} \in \mathbb{R}$ then the polynomial $f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$  defined by $f(x)=a_{0}+a_{1}x+\dots a_{n}x^{n}$ is continuous

If you cant prove it leave ISI

> [!theorem] 
> Let $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}$ and let $c\in A$. Suppose $f:A\to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous at $c$. Suppose $c\in B\in A$ define $g:B\to \mathbb{R}$ by $g(x)=f(x), \forall \ x \in B$ then $g$ is continuous at c

`\begin{proof}`
for $\upvarepsilon>0,$ there exist $\delta>0$  such that
$$
\begin{align}
		\left| f(x)-f(c) \right| <\upvarepsilon  \ \forall \ x \in(c-\delta,c+\delta)\cap A
\end{align}
$$
consider $x \in(c-\delta,c+\delta)\cap B$ then $x \in(c-\delta,c+\delta)\cap A$ and $g(x)=f(x)$
$$
\begin{align}
		\left| g(x)-g(c) \right| =|f(x)-f(c)|<\upvarepsilon
\end{align}
$$
`\end{proof}`

`\begin{proof}`
suppose ${x_{n}}$ is a sequence in A converging to $c$. 
We want to show that $\left\{ h(x_{n})\right\}$ converges to $h(c)$ 

$$
\begin{align}
h(x_{n})  & =g\left( f\left( x_{n}  \right)  \right)  \\
h(x_{n}) &  =g\left( f\left( c\right)  \right)  \text{ as } n\to \infty\\ 
h(x_{n})  & =g\left( f\left( c\right)  \right)  \\
\end{align}
$$
as $g(f(c))$ is continuous $h(x_{n})$ is also continuous
