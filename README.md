# Bmath Notes
This repository is for storing and sharing the notes I’ve written. I will try to frequently export these notes to the website. However, I don't recommend relying solely on this repository, as these notes may not always be complete or accurate. If you find any errors, please let me know—I'll be more than happy to update and correct them.The entire repository is completely free to use, so feel free to explore and learn!
Here’s the link to the website: https://sai-prabhav.github.io/bmath_notes/website/index. Please note that since it's hosted on GitHub, it may be a bit slow.
