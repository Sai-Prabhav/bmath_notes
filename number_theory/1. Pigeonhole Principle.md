>[!theorem] Pigeonhole Principle
if $n+1$ objects are distributed into $n$ boxes then at least one box contains two or more of the objects

## Example 
Let $a_{1},a_{2},\dots a_{m}$ be $m$ integers 
then $\exists \ k,l$ with $0\leq k<l\leq m$ such that 
$a_{k+1},a_{k+2},a_{k+3}\dots a_{l}$ is divisible by $m$

$$
\begin{align}
 & b_{1}=a_{1} \\
 & b_{2}=a_{1}+a_{2} \\ 
 & \vdots \\

 & b_{m}=a_{1}+a_{2}+\dots+a_{m} \\

\end{align}
$$
if any of the $b_{i }$ is divisible by m we are done as $k=0$ and $l=i$
Else from pigeonhole principle we know at least two of $b_{i}$ will have same residue say $b_{k},b_{l}$
then $m|b_{k}-b_{l} \implies m|a_{k+1},a_{k+2}\dots,a_{l}$

>[!theorem] Strong form of Pigeonhole principle
>let $q_{1},q_{2},\dots q_{n}$ be positive integers. If $q_{1}+q_{2}+q_{3}\dots+q_{n} -n+1$ boxes are distributed into n boxes then,
>either $1^{st}$ box contains at least $q_{1}$ objects,
>or the $2^{nd}$ box contains at least $q_{2}$ objects,
>so on,
>or the $n^{th}$ box contains at least $q_n$ objects

`\begin{proof}`
If $\forall i \in \left\{ 1,2,\dots n \right\}$ the $i^{th}$ box contains less than $q_{i}$ objects then the $n$ boxes can at most contain $q_{1}+q_{2}+\dots q_{n}-n$ objects
`\end{proof}`
