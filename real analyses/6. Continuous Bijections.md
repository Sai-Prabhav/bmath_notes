we claim $f(a)=c$ or $f(a)=d$ 

Suppose $c<f(a)<d$
then there exist some $p \in(a,b], \st f(p)=c$ 
also there exist some $q\in(a,b]$ such that $f(q)=d$
take $z=f(a)$ then by [[real analyses/5. Intermediate Value Theorem#^bb30ef|Intermediate Value Theorem]] 
there exist $r\in[p,q]\or[q,p]$ such that 
$f(r)=z=f(a)$
this contradicts the fact that $f$ is injective 
so, either $f(a)=c$ or $f(a)=d$

> [!claim] 
> if $f(a)=c$ then $f(b)=d$ and $f$ is strictly increasing

assume that this is not true and apply  [[real analyses/5. Intermediate Value Theorem#^bb30ef|Intermediate Value Theorem]]  
if $f$ is not strictly increasing as $f$ is increasing we can get $a\leq x< y\leq b$ such that $f(x)>f(y)$
