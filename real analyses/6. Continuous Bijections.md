We claim $f(a)=c$ or $f(a)=d$ 
Suppose $c<f(a)<d$
then there exist some $p \in(a,b], \st f(p)=c$ 
also there exist some $q\in(a,b]$ such that $f(q)=d$
take $z=f(a)$ then by [[real analyses/5. Intermediate Value Theorem#^bb30ef|Intermediate Value Theorem]] 
there exist $r\in[p,q]\or[q,p]$ such that 
$f(r)=z=f(a)$
this contradicts the fact that $f$ is injective 
So, either $f(a)=c$ or $f(a)=d$

> [!claim] 
> if $f(a)=c$ then $f(b)=d$ and $f$ is strictly increasing


Assume that this is not true and apply [[real analyses/5. Intermediate Value Theorem#^bb30ef|Intermediate Value Theorem]]  
If $f$ is not strictly increasing as $f$ is not increasing we can get $a\leq x< y\leq b$ such that $f(x)>f(y)$ 
 $f(x)>z>f(y)$ there exist $c \st f(c)=z ,x<c<y$ also there exist $f(a)<z<f(x)$ and $c'$ such that $f(c')=z, a<c'<x$ hence it is not injective 
 similarly we can show
