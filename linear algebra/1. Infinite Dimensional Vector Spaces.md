Vector spaces which are not finite dimensional are infinite dimensional vector spaces. 
That is if $\mathbf{V}$ is not is not spanned by a finite set.
## Example of spaces with $\infty$ dimension
1. All real polynomial space is a vector space 
2. Real Sequences
3. Convergent Sequences
4. Bounded sequences
5. All sequences with finitely many non - zero terms ^8a560a

>[!definition] Span of Infinite Set
Let $S$ be an infinite subset of $\mathbf{V}$
$\text{span } S= \left\{ v\in \mathbf{V}:v=c_{1}x_{1}+c_{2}x_{2} \dots +c_{n}v_{n}; c_{i}\in S \right\}$
Note: $n$ is finite 

>[!definition] Linear Independence of Infinite Set
>We say $S$ is Liner Independent If any finite subset of it is linearly independent.
>That is
>$c_{1}v_{1}+c_{2}v_{2}\dots c_{n}v_{n}=0  \text{ iff } c_{1}=c_{2}=c_{3}=\dots c_{n}=0 \text{ where } v_{i} \in S$
Note: $n$ is finite

>[!definition] Basis of Infinite Dimension spaces
>An infinite subset $S$ of $\mathbf{V}$ is said to be a basis iff $\text{span } S=\mathbf{V}$ and $S$ is linearly independent 

## Examples
If $e_{1}$ is the sequence $\left( 1,0,0\dots \right)$
If $e_{2}$ is the sequence $\left( 0,1,0,\dots \right)$Infinite
and so on 
$e_{j}$ is the sequence $(0,0,\dots,1,\dots 0)$ where $1$ in $j^{th}$ place 

The infinite set $(e_{1},e_{2},e_{3},\dots)$ will be the basis of infinite space in [[1. Infinite Dimensional Vector Spaces#^8a560a]]
