> [!definition]

> [!theorem] 
> Let $H$ be a $n\times n$ matrix in HCF then $r(H)$ is the number of  1 on the the diagonal of $H$ Also if the 1s ones are at the $i ,\dots i_{r}$ th positions then the $ith, ,\dots i_{r}$ th columns of $H$ form a basis of the $\csp{H}$ 
> 	$\csp{H}=\left\{ (x_{1},\dots x_{n})^{t}, x_{i}=0 \text{whenever}  i\neq i_{1},\dots.i+r\right\}$ 

`\begin{proof}` 
The no. of zero rows in $H$ is $n-r$ so, row rank of $H=r(H)\leq r$  But the $i_{1},\dots i_{r}$ columns are $e_{i_{1}},,\dots e_{i_{r}}$ which are linearly independent , so thre are atleast $r$ linearly independent vectors hence $r(H)=r$

$\implies(e_{i_{1}},\dots e_{i_{r}})$ forms a basis of $\csp{H}$ 


 `\end{proof}`

let $S_{n}$ be a group of all bijections on the set $\left\{ 1,2\dots n \right\}$
$S(X)$ be a set of all bijections from $x\to x$ we can define a binary operation on $S(X)$ as follows 
$S(X)\times S(X)\to S(X)$ 
$(f,g)\mapsto fog$
this makes $S(X)$ as a group 

$$
\begin{align}
	\sigma & =\begin{pmatrix}1 & 2 & 3\\ 2 & 1& 3\end{pmatrix}   \\
 & = \begin{pmatrix}	1 & 2 & 3\end{pmatrix} \text{ cyclic form}
\end{align}
$$

let $\sigma \in S_{n}$ be a permutation. Then there is a $n\times n$ matrix associated to $\sigma$ say $P_{\sigma}$ st. the ith row of $P_{\sigma}$ is $e_{j}$ where $\sigma(j)=i$ ie the ith row of $P_{\sigma}$ is $e_{\sigma^{-1}(i)}$ 
let $\sigma=\begin{pmatrix}	1 & 2 & 3\end{pmatrix}$ 

$$
\begin{align}
P_{\sigma} =\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0 & 1\\ 1 & 0& 0\\ 0 & 1& 0\end{bmatrix}  
\end{align}
$$

A permutation matrix is a square matrix, containing only $o$'s and 1's more over excatly one 1 in each row and one in each column 


Every permutation matrix $P$ is $P_{\sigma}$ for some $\sigma \in S_{n}$ 

> [!exercise] 
> det $P_{\sigma}=\pm1$



Pre-multiplication of a matrix by a permutation matrix $P\sigma$ permutes the rows of A, the ith row of $P_{\sigma}A$ it the $\sigma^{-1}(i)$ the row of A 
the post multiplication of $p_{\sigma}$ permutes the columns of A $i$ th column of A permutes to $\sigma(i)$ of A 


> [!lemma] 
> Let $H$ be a $n\times n$ matrix in HCF with rank $r$ then there exist a permutaion matrix $P$ such that $P^{-1}HP$ is of the form $\begin{bmatrix}I_{r} & B \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$

> [!proposition] If $H$ is a HCF then $H$ is an idempotent


`\begin{proof}` 
$P^{-1}HP=\begin{bmatrix}I_{r} & B \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}$
$$
\begin{align}
H^{2} & =PHP^{-1}PHP^{-1} \\
 & = P\begin{bmatrix}I_{r} & B \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix}P^{-1}  =H
\end{align}
 $$

> [!theorem] 
> Any square matrix can be reduced to a matrix in HCF by elementary row operations 

`\begin{proof}` 
Let A be a $n\times n$  matrix
we say that the first $k$ columns of A have Hermite property is they are the first $k$ columns of a matrix in the HCF, ie

i) $a_{ij}=0 \forall i>j , j\leq k$
ii) $a_{ii}=0 \or 1 \forall i=1,2\dots k$
iii) $a_{ij}=0 , i=1,\dots,j-1,j\dots n,\if a_{jj}=1,j\leq k$ 
iv) $a_{ij}=0 \forall j=1,2\dots k \if a_{jj}=1,j\leq k$


If the first column is a zero column then it is already in Hermite form.
If first column is non-zero, and $a_{11}\neq0$ then we normalize $a_{11}$ to 1 by dividing row 1 by $a_{11}$ if $a_{11}=0$ then we do a row interchange and make $a_{11}\neq 0$ and repeat as in the case $a_{11}\neq0$
we make the entries$a_{i{1}}=0 \forall i>1$ by elementary row operations this makes the first column in hermite for suppose by elementary row operations we made the first $j$ columns into hermite form.


Case 1:
There exist a non-zero entry on or below the diagonal in the $j$th column,ie $\exists$ an $i\geq j$ 
such that $a_{ij}\neq 0$ if $a_{jj}$ is not zero then do a suitable row interchange normalize $a_{jj}$ into a pivot and make all other entries in the $jth$ column zeros. if $a_{jj}\neq0$ then normalize and proceed

Case 2:

If the jth column is zero then we are done 

case 3:

$a_{ij}=o \forall i\geq j$ and $\exists l<j \st a_{lj}\neq0\text{ but } a_{ll}=0$ ie all elements on and below the diagonal in the jth column are zeros but $\exists$ a non-zero element $a_{lj}\neq0,l<j$ but $q_{ll}=0$ 
then we interchange the $l^{th}, j^{th}$ row and make all entries in the $jth$ colum zeros using $a_{jj}$ as the pivot


Case 4:
$a_{ij}=0 \forall i\geq j$ and for $l<j$ either $a_{lj}=0$ or $a_{ll}\neq0$ we leave it as it is

`\end{proof}`


Let $AX=b$ be a system of equation where A is $n\times n$ form the matrix $[A|I_{n}|B]$ 

If A is non-singular applying row operation of A reduces A to its RREF 
and applying the same operation on $I_n$ gives us $A^{-1}$ 
applying same operations on $b$ gives us the unique solution 


If A is singular reduce A to its HCF by applying row operations and apply same row operation on $I_{n}$ and $b$  as well Let us arrive at the following 

$$
\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix}
		\Huge{ H } & \Huge{ G } &\Huge{  d } \\

\end{bmatrix}    \\
\text{Let } d=(d_{1},\dots d_{n}  )^{t} 
\end{align}
$$

> [!remark] 
> $A_{m\times n}X=b$
> let $X_{0}$ be a particular solution of $AX=b$ all general solutions of $AX=b$ is 
> $\nsp{A}+X_{o}$
 > 

> [!theorem] 
> The system $AX=b$ is consistent iff $d_{i}=0$ whenever $h_{ii}=0$ then $d$ is a particular solution and $d+(I-H)y$ is a general solution for any arbitrary $y\in F^{n}$ 
> The non-zero columns of $I-H$ form a basis of the $\nsp{A}$ $G$ is a [[linear algebra/7. Generalised Inverse#^b20e1b|G-Inverse]]  of a if the $1$$s$ in the dioganal of $H$ occur in $i_{1},\dots i_{r}$ th places  BC as a rank factorization of A where 
> $B=[A_{*i_{1}},A_{*i_{2}},\dots A_{*i_{r}}]$ and $c=\begin{bmatrix} H_{i_{1}}* \\ H_{i_{2}}*  \\ \vdots \\ H_{i_{r}}* \end{bmatrix}$  where $A_{*i}$ is the ith column of A and $H_{i*}$ is the $i^{th}$ row of $H$ 



`\begin{proof}` 


$$
\begin{align}
\Huge{ \left[ A|I_{n}|b  \right] \xrightarrow{\text{row operations}} \left[ H|G|d \right]  }
\end{align}
$$


Let $P$ be the product of all the row operations applied 
$PA=H,PI_{n}=G,Pb=d$

$GA=H$ 

As $H$ is Hermite form $H=GA$ is idempotent. $r(GA)=r(H)=r(A)$
this shows $G$ is the g-inv of A 
$H$ is an idempotent 
$HX=d\equiv AX=b$
$H^{2}=H$ $I_{n}$ is a g-inv of $H$ $HI_{n}H=H$ so, $HI_{n}d=d$
so $d$ is the solution of $HX=d$ then $d$ is a solution of $AX=b$ is $\nsp{A}+d$ 

Now $\nsp{A}=\nsp{H}$ But $H$ is idempotent so $\nsp{A}=\csp{I-H}$ so a general solution of $AX=b$ is $\csp{I-H}+d$ ie, $(I-H)y+d$ for any $y\in F^{n}$


 `\end{proof}`

Let $T:V\to V$ be a linear map let $\mathcal{B}=(v_{1},\dots v_{n})$ be a basis of $V$ 
Matrix of $T$ with respective to $\mathcal{B}$ say A is obtained as follows ith column of A is the coordinate vector of $T(v_{i})$ wrt $\mathcal{B}$ 

$T(v_{i})=(v_{1},\dots,v_{n})\begin{bmatrix}a_{1i} \\ a_{2i} \\ \vdots \\ a_{ni}\end{bmatrix}\implies \mathcal{B}A_{i}$ 

Let $\mathcal{B}'=(v'_{1},\dots v'_{n}{})$ 
$\exists$ an invertable $n\times n$ matrix $P$ such that $\mathcal{B}'=\mathcal{B}P$
