Let A be a $n\times n$ matrix we want to decompose A into a lover triangle matrix $L$ with diagonal entries 1 and a upper triangle matrix $U$ , ie $A_{n\times n}=L_{n\times n}U_{n\times n}$ 
 
A row echelon is matrix is such that the
1. all non-zero rows are at the bottom  
2. the first non-zero elements of a row $i$ it to the left of the first non-zero elements of row i+1 at the bottom
Let A be a nxn matrix so that A can be reduced to a row echelon form by only using the row operation adding a row with a scalar multiplier of another row ie. A can be reduced to row echelon form by multiplying A from the left by elementary matrices of type I ie, $E-I_{n}+ae_{ij}$  

$E_{k}\dots E_{1}A=U$ 
$A=E^{-1}_{1}\dots E_{k}^{-1}U=LU,\quad E_{1}^{-1}\dots E_{k}^{-1}=L$


$E_{i}$ is a lower triangle matrix and product of them is a lower triangle matrix with diagonal 1


> [!theorem] 
> For $m\times n$ matrix A which can be reduced to row echelon form without interchanging the row then there exit a lower triangle matrix $L_{m\times m}$  with diagonal entries and an $m\times n$ matrix $U$ such that $A=LU$ 




$AX=B$ Let A be a $m\times n$ matrix such that A can be reduced to row echelon form, without row interchanges so there exist a $L$ lower triangular and $U$ such that $LU=A$ 
so, $LUX=b$ let $UX=Y$ we solve $LY=b$ 

Let $Y_{o}$ be a solution then we solve for $UX=Y_{0}$ 



Suppose A is a square matrix and A admits a LU decomposition $L$ has all diagonal entries 1

Let $u_{ii}=0$ then we mutliply the ith row of $u$ by $\frac{1}{u_{ii}}$ and produce an upper triangle matrix $U^{*}$ with dioganal entries 1 
we create nxxn diagonal matrix $D$ with $d_{ii}=u_{ii}$ 

$$
\begin{align}
U=DU^{*} 
\end{align}
$$
hence $A=LU=LU^{*}$ where 

1. $L$ is lower triangular with dioganal entries 1
2. $U$ is upper triangular with diagonal entries 1
3. $D$ is diagonal matrix with diagonals entries non-zero





invertible matrices admit a LU decomposition if all its leading principal minor are non-zero 
A singular matrix of rank $K$ admits a LU decompsition if the first $K$ leading principal minors are non-zero 

If a is a $m\times n$ matrix such that we need to use a row interchange to bring it to its row echelon form then we multiply A by a suitable permutation matrix $P$ from left so that PA (which has a rearrangement of the rows of A) uses no row interchange to get its row echelon form and then $PA=LU$
