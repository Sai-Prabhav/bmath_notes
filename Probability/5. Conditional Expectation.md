> [!definition]  Conditional Expectation
> Let  the joint pmf of $(X,Y)$ be $p(x,y)$ the conditional expectation of  $X$  given $Y=y$ 

$$
\begin{align} 
\ex[X|Y=y]  & =\sum_{x}xP_{\left(X|y=y\right) } (x) 
\end{align}
$$

## Example 
1.  $X$  , $Y$  are [[2. Covariance#^e3530d]] and [[2. Covariance#^976001]] Bin( $n$ , $p$  )
$$
\begin{align}
\ex[X|X+Y=m]=\frac{m}{2}(\text{ guess }) 
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align} 
P(X+k|X+Y=m) & = \frac{P(X=k,Y=m-k)}{P(X+Y=m)} \\
 & =\frac{P(X=k)P(Y=m-k)}{P(X+Y=m)} \\ \\

 & =\frac{\binom{n }{k}\binom{n}{m-k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k} p^{m-k}(1-p)^{n-[m-k]}}{\binom{2n}{m}p^{m}(1-p)^{2n-m}  }
\end{align}
$$
this distribution is similar to hyper-geometry with $2n$ total balls and  $n$  black balls and  $m$  ball are picked from it 
$$
\begin{align}
\sim \text{Hyper-Geometric}(2n,n,m)
\end{align}
$$

this has the expectation $\frac{m}{2}$
(todo::find the  $E$  of hyper-geometric distribution)

> [!definition] 
> $\ex[X|Y]$ is the function of Random veriable  $Y$  whose value at $Y=y$ is $\ex[X|Y=y]$ 

> [!remark] 
> $E(X|Y)$ is a Random variable depends on Y

> [!remark] 
> If  $X$  ,  $Y$  independent then $\ex[X|Y=y]=\ex[X]$ 

> [!theorem] 
> $\ex[{\ex[X|Y]}]=\ex[X]$ 


`\begin{proof}`
$$
\begin{align}
	\ex[X]  & =\sum_{x}^{} xP_{X}(x)    \\
 & =\sum_{x}x\sum_{y}^{}  p(x,y) \\
	 & =\Large{ \sum_{y}^{} P_{Y}(Y) \sum_{x}^{}x \frac{p(x,y)}{P_{Y}(y) }} \\ 
	 & \Large{ = \sum_{y}^{} P_{Y}(y)  E(X|Y=y)L }
\end{align}
$$

## Example 

1. Miner trapped in mine
There are 3 roads that miner can escape to each road has a  equal probability to be chose and the fist road takes 5 hours to and he comes back to the same place  and the middle road 3 hours and to escape and last road comes back to the same place after 7 hours 

let  $T$  be the RV time taken to escape 
$$
\begin{align}
\ex[T] 
\end{align}
