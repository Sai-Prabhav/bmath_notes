> [!definition] Conditional Expectation
> Let the joint pmf of $(X,Y)$ be $p(x,y)$ the conditional expectation of $X$ given $Y=y$ 

$$
\begin{align} 
\ex[X|Y=y] & =\sum_{x}xP_{\left(X|y=y\right) } (x) 
\end{align}
$$

## Example 
1. $X$ , $Y$ are [[2. Covariance#^e3530d|independent]] and
 [[2. Covariance#^976001|identical]]Bin( $n$ , $p$ )
$$
\begin{align}
\ex[X|X+Y=m]=\frac{m}{2}(\text{ guess }) 
\end{align}
$$



$$
\begin{align} 
P(X+k|X+Y=m) & = \frac{P(X=k,Y=m-k)}{P(X+Y=m)} \\
 & =\frac{P(X=k)P(Y=m-k)}{P(X+Y=m)} \\ \\

 & =\frac{\binom{n }{k}\binom{n}{m-k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k} p^{m-k}(1-p)^{n-[m-k]}}{\binom{2n}{m}p^{m}(1-p)^{2n-m} }
\end{align}
$$
this distribution is similar to hyper-geometry with $2n$ total balls and $n$ black balls and $m$ ball are picked from it 
$$
\begin{align}
\sim \text{Hyper-Geometric}(2n,n,m)
\end{align}
$$

this has the expectation $\frac{m}{2}$
(todo::find the $E$ of hyper-geometric distribution)

> [!definition] 
> $\ex[X|Y]$ is the function of Random veriable $Y$ whose value at $Y=y$ is $\ex[X|Y=y]$ 

> [!remark] 
> $E(X|Y)$ is a Random variable depends on Y

> [!remark] 
> If $X$ , $Y$ independent then $\ex[X|Y=y]=\ex[X]$

`\begin{proof}`
$$
\begin{align}
	\ex[X] & =\sum_{x}^{} xP_{X}(x) \\
 & =\sum_{x}x\sum_{y}^{} p(x,y) \\
	 & =\Large{ \sum_{y}^{} P_{Y}(Y) \sum_{x}^{}x \frac{p(x,y)}{P_{Y}(y) }} \\ 
	 & \Large{ = \sum_{y}^{} P_{Y}(y) E(X|Y=y)L }
\end{align}
$$

## Example 

1. Miner trapped in mine
There are 3 roads that miner can escape to each road has a equal probability to be chose and the fist road takes 5 hours to and he comes back to the same place and the middle road 3 hours and to escape and last road comes back to the same place after 7 hours 
 
Let $T$ be the RV time taken to escape $D$ is the door number
$$
\begin{align}
\ex[T] & =\ex[{\ex[T|D] }] \\
 & = \frac{1}{3}\left(\ex[T|D=1] +\ex[T|D=2]+\ex[T|D=3] \right)\\
 & = \frac{1}{3}\left(5+\ex[T] +3+7 +\ex[T] \right) \\
 \ex[T] & =15 
\end{align}
$$

2. $X_{1},X_{2}\dots$ independent RV with [[2. Covariance#^e3530d|independent]] with $\ex[X_{i}]=\mu$ for all $i$ 
 $N$ take value $1,2,3\dots$
 $N$ is independent of all $X_i$
 what is $E[X_{1}+X_{2}+X_3\dots X_{N}]$
$$
\begin{align}
\ex[X_{1}+\dots X_{N}|N =n ] & =\ex[X_{1}+\dots X_{n} ] \quad \text{ Independence of N and }X_{i} \\
 & =n\mu
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{align}
\ex[{\ex[X_{1}+\dots X_{N}|N ] }] & =E[N\mu ] \\
 & =\mu \ex[N] 
\end{align}

> [!exercise] 
> Roll a pair of dice if the sum is 2,3 or 12 player loses  if 7 or 11 wins if sum is any other  $i$  then the player continues to roll the dice sum is either 7 or  $i$  if it is  7 player losses 
> if it is  $i$  player wins 
>  $R$  is a RV rolls in a game
